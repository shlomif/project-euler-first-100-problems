Right triangles with integer coordinates

The points P (x_(1), y_(1)) and Q (x_(2), y_(2)) are plotted at integer
co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,
0 ≤ x_(1), y_(1), x_(2), y_(2) ≤ 2.

Given that 0 ≤ x_(1), y_(1), x_(2), y_(2) ≤ 50, how many right triangles can
be formed?
